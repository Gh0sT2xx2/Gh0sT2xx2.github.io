## Ethical Considerations

Each project is designed with ethical use in mind:
- **Respect Privacy**: Always ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations.
- **Legal Compliance**: Adhere to all applicable laws when conducting security research or bug hunting.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: If vulnerabilities are discovered, follow responsible disclosure practices.
- **Defensive Use Only**: Tools like the Blue Team Framework are for defense, not for unauthorized or malicious activities.
